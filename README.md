This is a wrapper on the sumy library of python. A ready to use text summarizer which is just a clone away and can we used for quick experimentation.

By default we are using LexRankSummarizer method to do the automatic text summarization on a given corpus.
For the time being the corpus needs to be updated in the refer.txt file which is kept empty for the time being.

python3 run.py  /aboslute/path/to/the/text/file/with/.txt/extension

If you don't have a text file then copy your desired text to the file called refer.txt without the filename in the command line.

and see the magic after that.

This is created for quick experimentation on text summarizer.

I will add for parameter so that the configuration of the summarizer can be completely configured!
