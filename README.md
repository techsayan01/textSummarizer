This is a wrapper on the sumy library of python.

By default we are using LexRankSummarizer method to do the automatic text summarization on a given corpus.
For the time being the corpus needs to be updated in the refer.txt file which is kept empty for the time being.

After the corpus is copied to the "refer.txt" file,
we need to trigger

python3 test.py

and see the magic after that.

This is created for quick experimentation on text summarizer.

I will add for parameter so that the configuration of the summarizer can be completely configured!
